# WordPress Homes Valuator

## Introduction

Valuator allows users to create landing pages that give visitors the ability to quickly valuate their home.

The plugin hooks into Zillow using the official API, queries the home value, and returns the value to the page.

The website owner is able to collect the name, email, and address information of the user and has a new potential customer.
